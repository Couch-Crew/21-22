# brief
My project is an Indian card game called Desi Ya Pardesi. It is a mashup of Cards Against Humanity and Pass the Parcel.

## Why are you doing this project?
When I went online to shop for card games, I found a lack of fun family-friendly card games. So, I took it upon myself to make a card game that Indian families actually want to play when game night comes.

## What was your biggest challenge?
My biggest challenge was translating all my cards. I had to make sure that each of the 306 cards had accurate translations. Also, working alone on such a big project was very overwhelming at times.

## What was your biggest succcess?
I found lots of success using Nandeck to build my card deck. It made making changes to the card deck easier.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
After the Hatch, I hope to finish playtesting Desi Ya Pardesi and launch a KickStarter to help fund this project further!

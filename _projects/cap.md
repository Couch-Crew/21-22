# brief
My project is bringing the organization, Civil Air Patrol to Novi. I think my project is good for students that join CAP, giving leadership opportunities. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I needed to find a new meeting place for my squadron and our squadron needs more members. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
My biggest challenge was getting rejected from the school when I asked to make CAP a club in NHS.

## What was your biggest succcess?
My greatest success was finding a church that was willing to let us use their space.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
My plan is to hopefully get enough members to make up for the cadets leaving after this summer and more. Once the cadets join, I will start training them to prepare for this summer's encampment.

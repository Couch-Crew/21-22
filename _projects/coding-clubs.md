# brief
Kids Coding Club in Orchard Hills! 
In effort to close the gender gap and interest younger students in the Computer Science field, I have started to make coding clubs at elementary schools. Orchard Hills is the first club official kids coding club made!

## Why are you doing this project?
I was unable to know to find out about coding or my love for it until high school. I want to give kids the opportunity to find their passions at an earlier age.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Getting a volunteer system set up. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
Getting an orchard hills program up and running for this year and next year.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I want to get these clubs in all elementary schools in Novi.

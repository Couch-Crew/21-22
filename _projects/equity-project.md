# brief
The Equity Project is an initiative working to end the inequities in our education system specifically those within public education. As a result of these problems being so extensive I am focusing on one issue at inorder to have the greatest impact and long term success. This year's focus is Diversity Equity and Inclusion or DEI along with alumni from U of M's Summer Youth Dialogues program I held two student led professional development for NHS staff members.

## Why are you doing this project?
My Great Grandmother Sweetpea taught each and every one of us that our education is our most valuable tool. She never had the opportunity to go to high school because she began helping to support her family at thirteen picking cotton in Memphis, Tennessee after the unexpected passing of her father. My Mom being an English teacher in inner-city schools  I saw the inequities in our education system firsthand. Because of the amazing women in my life, this passion of mine was born and this year I developed "The Equity Project".

## What was your biggest challenge?
My original plan was to work with state and or local reps as a result of their busy schedules I had to keep going back to the drawing board.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Teacher engagement having such a large number of our staff members interested and wanting to participate was so wonderful. 

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I hope to take on opportunities to work against the inequities in education system whether be expanding "The Equity Project" into a non profit or taking on positions in law or politics.

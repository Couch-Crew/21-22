# brief
 SAE Jewelry is our brand where we sell rings and (soon) bracelets. SAE stands for Support Asian Empowerment. Each piece of our jewelry holds specific messages in uplifting the asian community and combating the ongoing asian hate. It has been a very positive experience so far and not only has it educated us in the field of asian hate, we learned about business and taking initiative. Our proceeds will go to the Stop Asian Hate foundation.

## Why are you doing this project?
This is something that affects the both of us as well as our community because we are both Asian and live in a diverse community. There has also been an alarming rise in Asian hate since covid and we've felt the need to combat this in anyway we can. We chose to do jewelry because we both have interest in jewelry and because jewelry is something that people can wear everyday. This way people can be reminded as well as remind others about Asian hate by putting on a simple piece of jewelry.

## Who did what?
Ember was responsible for handling social media as well as logo design and the financial aspects. Joslyn was responsible for making the jewelry. We both created the meaning behind our company as well as the material and design choices. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
Our biggest challenge was deciding on how to sell and distribute our rings. We decided to sell locally.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Our greatest success was our social media.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
We plan on continuing this in college and growing our brand on a greater scale with larger resources at MSU.

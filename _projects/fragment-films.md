# brief
A video editing project to create a variety of video contents for teens of today's society.

## Why are you doing this project?
After having to quit art classes a few years ago, I lost my creative outlet and my escape from the chaos of everyday life. So, when I signed up for Incubator, I knew I wanted to do something to combine my interest in visual art with my interest in our developing digital world, and video editing happened to be the perfect bridge. Through video, you can teach, entertain, and express your personal thoughts and feelings, so I found the versatility appealing.

## What was your biggest challenge?
I think, as anyone with a hobby understands, being forced to do something that you love changes your own appreciation for it, because then it seems like the intention is to approach it like work, just to finish it. So sometimes after I’ve been doing editing for a while I’ll reach a period of burnout or creative block and I have to step back before I can approach it again with the perspective of doing something for myself. That also ties into being self critical and losing time. Especially since I’m approaching it like an art, I spend a lot of time fixing details until I’m fully satisfied with them. Editing is also the type of thing that you have to spend larger chunks of time on to learn, rather than just piece by piece, so setting aside larger chunks of time has been a challenge.

## What was your biggest succcess?
I’ve had several overarching successes, the biggest being just getting accustomed to using the video editing software and learning how to turn my ideas into a tangible product. The process has also helped develop me my organizational skills and gain new creative perspectives in the sense that being behind the camera changes how you see other videos, and you get to notice more of the effort and intentional choices that go into the production of any and all types of content. And of course, having fun is a huge success; I definitely think that editing is a therapeutic outlet and it’s been helping me exercise the creative skills that I haven’t had the opportunity to use in a while.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
In terms of the Hatch, I know I for sure that I want to have videos in 2 or 3 broad categories. One of them I want to be somewhat educational, and teach about something that anyone could find intriguing. One of them I know I want to be simply entertaining, whether it’s a compilation of funny videos or possibly comedic storytelling. Then the third one is a bit more flexible, it might take the shape of more of a vlog form, or I could look more into the bite-sized content that has a big presence on TikTok and Youtube. After the Hatch I don't have specific plans about where I want my video editing journey to go, but I hope that it'll be an outlet I can revisit in the future (perhaps in college) when I want to exercise my creative skills.

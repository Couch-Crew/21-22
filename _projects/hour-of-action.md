# brief
Hour of Action has been so fun to create and implement this year. I think it's something that is so important, as activism is crucial in today's society. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I'm doing this project to encourage civic engagement among the youth and create tangible change for societal issues.

## What was your biggest challenge?
The biggest challenges were creating a presentation that is engaging enough and finding research for the action toolkits.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Hosting 3 events and having over 40 participants in one of them was my biggest success.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I want to continue to make these toolkits and host events with other actions. Some plans I have in the future are to set up a social media and reach out to more organization to make more customized toolkits.

# brief
The Run With Us Club is a a running club to get non-runners motivated to get out there and run. The running club has been going on for about 11 weeks. Towards the middle of May we are planning on participating in a professionally ran 5k. The runners in the club will register in the 5k and get an idea of how much they've improved from week 1 to week 11 based on their times.

## Why are you doing this project?
The main reason I'm doing this is because growing up I've always loved running and people have always seen running as something to punish people for and this club was my way of negating that and showing people it can be fun if you make it fun. This project is really meaningful to me because although, I could not run as much as I wanted to throughout the club, the members in the club continued to run on their own. The inspiration for this project came from my Cross Country Team. Before I even made this club I consulted them to see what problems they may have seen from running, and motivating runners was at the top of all of their lists.

## What was your biggest challenge?
My biggest challenge in my project was definitely to gather non-runners to actually get outside and run. Today, many people see running as a punishment and gathering people to come outside and participate in this club was very difficult. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
In my opinion, my greatest success has got to be being able to get to see how much this club has grown and the amount of people that have stayed in the club. When I first made this club, my goal was to reach 15 because I knew how difficult it would be to motivate non-runners. Currently, we are at 30 and the notebook journal of mileages per runner has grown since the very start of this club.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
After the Hatch, I plan stopping this club but that was the plan since the very beginning. The hope is that the people in this club understand what running can really do for them in the long-run. I hope they continue to run even when this club is over and make running apart of their daily life.

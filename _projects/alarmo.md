# brief
Alarmo is a preasure sensitive pad that sits under your mattress. It will ring at the time set. And it won't turn off until the user gets off of the bed. 

## Why are you doing this project?
To help people wake up on time! We realized we were having a lot of trouble with waking up on time for school. And for that reason, it seemed like the most relevant problem to us. 

## Who did what?
We both worked on most things together. I was usually in charge of coding the Arduino. Where as Ribal was usually in charge of wiring the entire thing. We've gotten a lot of help from Amr, so a lot of times we'll all work on one thing together at the same time.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Learning C++ and learning how to circuit a bread board.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Finishing our website helped give us somewhat of an official feeling, that this idea could go places. But the largest successes so far have been small things that we've been able to do with the Arduino. Like getting LEDs to light up or the buzzr to make noise.

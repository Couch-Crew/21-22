# brief
OK Bloomer is an app that incentivizes users to finish tasks with a plant animation each time they check off a task. It's for those who struggle with motivation or energy. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I'm doing this project because I struggle with motivation severely since I struggle with depression. One of the things that helps me immensely is to make a checklist of all the small tasks I need to do and cross them off. Seeing my finished tasks visually makes me feel accomplished and thus, I got the motivation for this app. The plant animation is just a more visual way to see it. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
Coding! Swift is a language that I'm not completely fluent in so I had to simultaneously learn it while coding. It's a completely different interface so it took a while to get the hang of the language and code it. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
I'm proud of the design because I think it's visually appealing while also speaking to the fact that life is a journey. It was fun to do the UI/UX because I could be as creative as possible and design it to my liking. 

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I plan to work on the app in college because I'm majoring in computer science and I hope I can use that knowledge to make the app fully functional.

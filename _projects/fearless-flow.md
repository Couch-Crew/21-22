## Why are you doing this project?
All three of us being menstruators have our own experiences with period stigma that have pushed us to start our campaign.   Whether it be feeling awkward when asking our dads to take us to buy products, hiding products when walking to the bathroom, hearing comments like "are you PMS-ing", or cultural stigma. It's an extremely frustrating feat that most don't challenge as they've been taught to accept the attitude for the way that it is. We are pursuing this initiative to end the taboo surrounding periods to ensure that every menstruator is comfortable in their own body.  As menstruation is a regular bodily health function that so many people experience daily it shouldn't be one people feel ashamed or embarrassed to speak out on. Not to mention, without the basic conversation periods many are unfortunately uninformed about serious health risks that they may be facing. Working together over the past two years we have grown tremendously as activists, what started as simple conversations within our circles, and growing comfortable in our bodies as menstruators we are now able to aid others in doing the same, making this project incredibly meaningful and rewarding to us. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
Translating our work to the future. How will we keep an impact at Novi High School after we leave. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
- Removal of the Tampon Tax in Michigan after many years of reintroducing. 24th state to repeal tampon tax. 
- Free Menstrual Products in all Novi City Buildings ( police station, fire station, civic center, etc.)
- Free Menstrual Products in Novi High School restrooms(five restrooms as well as the offices stocked with menstrual products)

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
Finding leadership in other period activism organizations at the university level. Making sure Fearless Flow Foundation's impact is sustainable at Novi High School, and continues to grow at UofM.

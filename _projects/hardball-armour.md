# brief
Harball Armour's back/rib guard is baseball protective equipment used to protect against wild pitches that hit batters in the back. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I was inspired to do this project when I got hit in the back by a pitch yet again in the fall and I came to school the next Monday with a big bruise on my rib cage.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Finding a way to attach the foam to the shirt securely without sewing.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Finding a type of foam that will protect against a pitch without getting in the way of range of motion. Also shaping this foam into a design that will cover the desired area without again being to bulky.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I hope to come up with a solid prototype that I can hopefully wear in my games.

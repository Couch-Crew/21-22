# brief
Meal Mania is an app that will flip the decision making process of eating out. When you choose where you want to eat out and either feel indecisive or even want to try something completely random, Meal Mania is the app for you. Essentially, any user would open the app, take a brief mood survey, set restaurant filters, and get a few restaurant results catered to the users' desires. 

## Why are you doing this project?
When I go out to eat, I often find myself not knowing what I should get. After discussing with my peers and researching, I found that feeling indecisive when deciding what to eat is a popular dilemma. Mixing my two interests of coding and food together, I wanted to create Meal Mania to solve the problem of food indecisiveness. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
One of the biggest challenge is the prototype development. App development opened a completely new door of programming to me, so it has definitely been an interesting learning experience. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
A few of the biggest accomplishments in building the prototype has been bringing in functioning filtering tools and restaurant data. I have been able to create a profile sample and am working to build more soon. 

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
My goal is to finish my app prototype by June 2022 and start pitching my app to investors in hopes of strengthening the development and design of the app.

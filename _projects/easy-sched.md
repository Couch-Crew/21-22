# brief
I think my project is a great start to a program that could be even more beneficial for students in the future.
You can view the website <a target='blank' href='https://easysched.jtauro.repl.co'> here </a>.

## Why are you doing this project?
I wanted to teach myself how to create a website and provide a support tool for parents and students who are confused by high school scheduling.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Learning new coding languages and finding out information about them in new ways.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Getting my design for my website out of my head and written into working code!

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
Although I will not continue to update my program annually, I hope it can be an inspiration to future students and possibly a starting point in case another Incubator student would like to take it further.

# brief
A board game designed for those with spectrum disorders as well as their family members to practice social situations.The game is played with a series of roleplay cards as well as a colorful board to reach the finish line.

## Why are you doing this project?
Originally, I intended to work on detecting the tone of other people's voices. I went to Franchi and Maguire to pitch my idea, and they said I could make a product for autistic children. Many adolescents and teenagers with autism spectrum disorders are unable to recognize social cues, including the original concept of voice tone. Throughout my life I have been a part of peer programs with autistic students and I have seen their everyday struggles.The purpose is for players with spectrum disorders to be able to practice scenarios in the off chance that they might be in them in real life. Hopefully with practice they are able to handle the situations better. If my product can help make a players day a little less stressful,I will be more than happy!

## What was your biggest challenge?
Franchi and Maguire thought my game might be a bit too easy for my audience. So I went to Mrs.Lee to make sure it was appropriate for her students. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
Meeting with Mrs.Lee to present to her the finished product was a success! She stated that my work will benefit many of her students and that the scenarios are ideal for roleplaying.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
By The Hatch I want to have 3 copies of the board game. I am giving them to Mrs. Lee's classroom for her current and future students to use. I have no plans to continue with my project after The Hatch or sell it to make any profit.

# brief
We are very happy with our progress so far. Honestly, neither of us thought we would actually be able to create a tangible product. And we believe that we have come a long way from creating prototypes on the backroom Cricut machine.

## Why are you doing this project?
In our ever-growing society, we have seen a massive push for mental health awareness. Plastered on the walls of schools, social media posts, books, and even organizations dedicated to its cause, mental health awareness has gone from zero to hero. So why not put it on a shirt -- better yet, a brand.

## Who did what?
- Omair Shamsher -- Design, Website
- Sriganesh Ballim -- Logo, Social Media

## What was your biggest challenge?
- Getting people to actually buy our clothing; marketing to people outside our friends and family.
- Figuring out the layout of our website, the cut the production company makes, and other logistical issues. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
- We have a tangible product line
- We have over 10 sales
- We have reached almost 100 dollars in profit
- We have a wonderful, easy-to-use website

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
As of right now, we are halting our plans until we get to 50 sales. We want to be able to fully focus on how to get people to buy the product that we have right now. If and when we reach 50 sales, we will release new designs and maybe new types of clothing (pants, hats, etc.)

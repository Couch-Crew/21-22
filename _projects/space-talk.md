# brief
A virtual event with fourth-grade classrooms to introduce students to various careers in space exploration. Students learned about different space related jobs and participated in a hands-on constellation game. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I've loved space since I was little, and even as a kid I knew I wanted to be a part of exploring our universe. Last Summer, I had the opportunity to go to Space Camp and learn about the history of space exploration and its surrounding careers. Now I'm a Junior in High School and know I want to major in Aerospace Engineering. I chose to host this event because I want to introduce kids to space related jobs and show them how space exploration presents career opportunities in many different fields. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
- Creating a presentation for fourth graders that was both engaging and informative. 
- Coordinating the logistics of the event and materials.

## What was your biggest succcess?
- Receiving stickers from NASA's informal education office to pass out to the students
- Hosting a successful event that the kids enjoyed for four fourth-grade classrooms.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?

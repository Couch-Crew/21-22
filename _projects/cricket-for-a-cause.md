# brief
My cricket game is a great way to bring exposure to cricket in the United States, more specifically our school. Students vs. Staff + food is a adds a fun incentive to bring people to the stands. 

## Why are you doing this project?
My project is a great way to "kill two birds with one stone": I'm raising money for SEWA, which is an organization in India that helps with women's social justice. Also, I wanted to bring exposure to cricket to Novi High School.

## What was your biggest challenge?
- Getting teachers to play
- Had to cancel the event on April 22 due to rain

## What was your biggest succcess?
- Having teachers be so interested in playing
- Having so many students eager to play
- Sponsor for snacks
- T-shirts made
- People eager to come to the game

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
The game will be held on May 18th, and with this game, I'm hoping to raise a lot of money and have people enjoy the game!

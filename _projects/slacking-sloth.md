# brief
My project is a productivity app that uses a point-reward system of gamification to motivate the user to complete tasks. I have been working on it throughout the year, and it has been one of the toughest projects I have taken on. However, I believe it was worth it because I think that my project is a unique way to help someone change their habits. My app is at a good place right now, and I have been working diligently in this last month to code the aspects of my app that are distinctive, like team integration. 

## Why are you doing this project?
As someone who often procrastinates in my own life, I personally feel like motivation is something that we all need in our lives. However, I wanted to make tasks fun and inspire people to actually get excited about changing their habits and being more responsible. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
My biggest challenge with this project was actually learning the coding basics and starting to incorporate them into Xcode. Because I was learning by myself through Youtube tutorials and guides, the process of dealing with errors and figuring out how to implement things took very long.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Some of my biggest successes while working on my app were actually the little things like fixing an error in the code when something wouldn't run. Since I wouldn't be able to move forward without fixing the error, I would feel really satisfied when my code would work.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
As of right now, I am working on fine-tuning the back-end aspects of my code and my goal is to have a prototype version of my app by the Hatch that users can interact with. I hope to work on my app and create a more polished version of it over the summer if users like the prototype version of my app.

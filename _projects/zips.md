# brief
My project is based on the idea of switchability when it comes to shoes. Being able to rotate logos,soles, and extra accessories with ease. The project was originally geared towards creating a more tangible product which happened but not up my expectations which is why I moved towards making it more online and demonstrating the idea online.

## Why are you doing this project?
I picked this project due to my interest in shoes whether wearing them,buying or selling them. More specifically though I was inspired by shoe surgeon who is someone who does what my product does but with shoes that aren't meant to be taken apart which is why it is so expensive. Additionally the environmental positions that many companies are focused on fall in with the idea of this shoe.

## What was your biggest challenge?
The tangible production of the shoe as the quality of it did not match up to a standard in which the shoe was actually wearable.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Back in January the idea of using a zipper in order to facilitate the idea of switchability for the sole was a good landmark. Additionally I also now have a way to accurately demonstrate that aspect online.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
Biggest change is moving from focusing on a tangible item I now have something online and will a demonstration of my idea during the hatch.

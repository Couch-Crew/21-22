# brief
Not Just a Phone is a social media campagin that focuses on iPhone photography by holding workshops that teach skills that help with portait, nature, and Instagram photos. The goal of Not Just a Phone is to capture every meaningful moment and spread happiness. There will be several mini workshops were they would be focused on one skill like candid photography before a main one where all topic would be covered. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I have always loved photography because it has been a huge part of my life. Growing up my parents would always carry around a camera everywhere capturing every moment possible and that really inspired me to start learning the art. I chose my project because now everyone is carrying phones around everywhere and taking pictures with their phones. Since they are so important now, I thought everyone should be able to take high quality pictures with their phones without having expensive equipment like SLR camera and other tools.

## What was your biggest challenge?
One of my biggest challenge was loosing all the Instagram followers my Not Just a Phone page had. I had gained over 400 followers and my account suddenly got deleted, so I had to start all over again. That caused two of my mini workshops to be pushed because all the details and sign-up sheet access was gone. Another big challenge was the weather, everytime I would want to hold a workshop there was either rain or snow causing so much  confustion for all those who signed up to come. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
I believe my greatest success is my learner guide that I created for anyone who would attend my workshop. I spend all of first semseter learning and brushing up my phone photography skills and chose the best tips to create a detailed guide that everyone would get when they came to my workshop. This guide contained everything from defintions of some commonly found words to screenshots of where to find some functions on the phone. Another sucess was my mini workshop in December and my big workshop in April because I learned a lot and people were really satisfied.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
Currently I will be having mini workshop on Sunday for those who had signed up last week but couldn't attend because of the rain. After that, I want to conduct more mini workshops and gain enough evidence so I could have a paid event. I want to potentially continue this in college because I am very passionate about photography.

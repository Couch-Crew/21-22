# brief
An event on April 8th from 3 to 4:30 PM for all NHS students to learn more about skin and skincare. The event consisted of a 1 hour interactive presentation and a 30 minute Q&A session with local dermatologist, Dr. Kartono. The audience left with new knowledge, snacks/water, free samples and Dr. Kartono's business card. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I did this project because skincare is something I'm quite passionate in. In my freshmen year, I suffered with severe acne that was caused from incorrectly using products and not understanding my skin. If it wasn't for a few product recommendations that helped me get started in the right direction, I wouldn't have the skin I have today. 

An issue that is pretty prominent is a lot of people don't have access to a medical professional and instead rely on most of their information from social media which can be wrong and even harmful in certain cases. When thinking on how to help solve this issue, I did not want to add to the various social media influencers that already existed and I wanted whatever I did to be meaningful and personable. 

Before I fully came up with this idea, I had a feeling I wanted to do something with skincare but I couldn't understand exactly what since there was already a lot information online/the cosmetic industry was oversaturated. When I couldn't figure out what to do, I focused on perhaps getting more workshops in our city for people to learn and have a place to relax.
 
Eventually I was able to come to the conclusion of partially combining my old ideas - holding a skincare workshop, The Skincare Retreat.

## What was your biggest challenge?
My biggest challenge was probably staying organized in planning such a big event since a lot of smaller details would get overlooked. I also found that finding a dermatologist wasn't easy at first but when I got a contact, everything eventually fell into place. Marketing was one of my biggest issues because I found it hard to let the student body know about what I was doing. I tried a lot of methods but still found it to be hard. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
My greatest success would be finding a helpful dermatologist that gave tips on how to find reliable information and helped out getting free samples to my audience. Another success was creating the presentation which I worried about it not being interactive enough or too much information but I think I was able to keep a lot of things balanced. A way I combatted the too much information part was giving out a brochure which encompassed a lot of information from the presentation. I also would say my turn out to the event was great. I had around 44 people attend the event.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I think I was able to achieve my goal for this project. If I wasn't a senior and had more time with this project, I would've loved to do another session.

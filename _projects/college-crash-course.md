# brief
My project is a college application preparation workshop that prepares juniors prior to the the summer to mitigate the fall stress.

## Why are you doing this project?
Juniors already go through enough stress as it is, providing assistance with the college application process will allow them to avoid some of that much anticipated stress.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Finding an ideal date that works for both juniors and volunteers. It is hard to assess when juniors will be ready to start this long process. Another challenge was getting teacher volunteers because the date had to change based on teacher availability.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Putting together workshops. I feel like I have a solid plan for the setup of each station. 

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I have the stations set completely, now I have to find an adult to be present during my event since I had to change the date because of that.

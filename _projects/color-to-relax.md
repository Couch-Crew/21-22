# brief
Color to Relax is a one-time event in Novi High School. It is where students can color, relax and have fun after a long day of school. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I noticed that so many of my peers never get the time to relax on their own. The inspiration for my project started off from my hobby of coloring. I chose to do this project because I want to help peers around me to relax and not feel stressful about any situation.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Some of the biggest challenges I faced doing this project was not able to spread my message about the event in the beginning. Overthinking about my project too much.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Some of the greatest successes include having my things planned out for the event. 

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I am planning to continue this project in college as starting a one time event if I have time to do it and also my plan is to post coloring quotes on social media to inspire more people to color and relax.

# brief
My project focuses on not creating a FULL drink and not compromising on anything about the drink. Splendid spice also has a lot of unique and different drink combinations that feature spices.  

## Why are you doing this project?
What inspired me to do this project was the fact that I have always loved sugary drinks, a little too much, and I walkways felt that I was drinking the same flavor always whether it was iced tea lemonade or just a simple cola. I felt like I could put my fiery twist on a drink. I would also check the sugar content and the ingredient content and felt that most drinks on the market fail on something about the drink whether it is too expensive, not healthy, or just too boring.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Some Biggest Challenges I have faced were definitely being able to sell my drinks and also create my drinks because in order for me to sell them I need a food license which takes up a lot of money and time. Also, I had big problems in actually creating the drinks because the costs started to pile up and the drink would not come out right in consistency or taste. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
Some Great successes have been creating the commercial because I started to pick up on video editing pretty fast and the commercial looked like. a professional commercial. Another success would be the labeling. I thought this would be the hardest part of creating the drink because of the amount of research and work that needs to be put into it. Finally, another big success would be the website because I also had no clue about creating a functional website. 

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
I will also have a commercial and fully functional website in 2 weeks.

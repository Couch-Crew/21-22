# brief
Mind to Heart Heart to Hands is a fundraiser that was created to show awareness and support through press on nails. Each set of the mental health nails sold a portion of proceeds will go towards TinyChanges, a mental health organization in Scotland that works to uplift voices as well as inspire change that will transform mental health in young adults. 

## Why are you doing this project?
I'm passionate about mental health and I wanted to take the opportunity to support an organization that is also motivated towards mental health. 

## What was your biggest challenge?
Picking the charity was the hardest part because there were so many great organizations to donate too. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
Getting permission from TinyChanges to use their organization as part of the fundraiser. I was super excited to get the opportunity to work with an amazing organization. They were super nice when I reached out and very supportive. 

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
Originally I planned on making the fundraiser a one-month event, but decided that I would continue to sell the nails and donate. I would also like to donate to other organization with different causes as well as continue to use my shop as a way to help others.

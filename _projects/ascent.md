# brief
We think our project has gone well, and despite having a different product from what we first envisioned, we are satisfied with our work this year.

## Why are you doing this project?
The reason we chose this project was because we both enjoy computer science and would like to go into it for our careers. We thought a multiplayer 3D game would provide us with a challenge for the entire year. We also like playing video games in our free time, so we had a lot of experience and inspiration to draw from.

## Who did what?
Amr was responsible for the technical aspects of the project which included working with our game engine, writing the code, integrating game assets into the program, and creating the user-interface. Scott was responsible for the creative design, constructing the maps, and coordinating collaboration. Masaru was responsible for character design and development.

## What was your biggest challenge?
One of our biggest challenges was how labor-intensive work game development is. From the beginning we were ambitious with our plans from having a online network of servers to several different high detail maps. By the end of our project, we fell short of several goals we set forward. Firstly, we were only able to complete one high detail map, a half completed one, and a low detail training map. Secondly, we were able to have multiplayer capabilities on a local network, although we weren't able to figure out how to create an online network of servers with a stable connection to each player's computer. Thirdly, we were only able to create one character model when, alternatively, we planned to have several models with different character items that would customize our player's character.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Although we had several set-backs, we've had a myriad of successes. For example, we were able to create a game that could run on most middle-of-the-pack computers with our game's being graphics far better than we planned. We also produced a map that exceeded our expectations with another map partially complete.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
Once we complete our alpha release at the end of the school year, we plan on finishing any left over, partially uncompleted work if we are available during the summer.

# brief
Ez Eats is an app that makes ordering at restaurants easier for those with dietary restrictions (allergies, vegan/vegetarian, halal, etc.) By automatically filtering restaurant menus, users can quickly figure out what they can order at a variety of places. 

## Why are you doing this project?
Personally having dietary restrictions, we were motivated to make it easier to eat out in a quick and simple way. It's always been somewhat of a struggle having to pore over menus to find the few possible options, and we think that our app offers a solution for us and for any others with dietary restrictions. 

## Who did what?
Abhishek worked on data collection and implementation. Jimmy worked on user interface and design. Both of us worked on overall app functionality and development.

## What was your biggest challenge?
We are coding our app in Flutter, so our biggest challenge has been learning the language. Collecting data has also been an issue.

## What was your biggest succcess?
Our greatest success so far has been the design of our app. It looks very polished and is also easy to use. All the screens (home screen, adding users, restaurant search, and menu screen) have a consistent and sleek design.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
We plan on completing our app with full functionality for several restaurants in May. We will then attempt to get our app on the Google Play Store and App Store.

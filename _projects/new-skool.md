# brief
New Skool was born out of a desire to offer an alternative to traditional spirit wear options. Drawing inspiration from Principal Carter's "It's Another Great Day to be a Novi Wildcat."
Our hoodies and shirts represent the endless opportunity present at NHS. We hope our clothing line inspires you to face every day with positivity.

## Why are you doing this project?
We are doing this project to create affordable and fashionable spirit wear for students and teachers that they can wear to show there wildcat pride

## Who did what?
Grace was responsible for creating the design of the shirt and she also ran the Twitter account.

Sahithi was responsible for running the instagram as well sorting out the manufacturing aspects 

## What was your biggest challenge?
Biggest challenge was coming up with the design itâ€™s self we went back and forth with many ideas till we found one that resonated with us. We also struggled with finding a company that would produce our hoodies.

## What was your biggest succcess?
We have sold over a 100 products our greatest success is seeing everyone around school wearing our hoodies and all the great postive feedback we have received from our peers and teachers

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
New Skool is happy to have reached their goal of getting affordable, trendy school spirit wear into the hands of Novi high schoolers. The second launch marked the end of sales and the close of this Incubator Project.

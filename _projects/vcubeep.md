# brief
The electronics industry is rapidly evolving, and the VisualCube Education Platform aims to help. With an industry-standard system of circuits and software, and extensive educational material to back it up, the platform will give hobbyists and schools alike a starting point for getting into electronics and coding.

## Why are you doing this project?
Honestly, I am doing this project because I don't want to be the only high school student heavily involved in the electronics industry. What I do is a lot of fun, and can clearly be done and tried well before someone makes it their career. I really believe that getting industry standard tech into the hands of people sooner will help the industry grow as people will have more overall experience.

## What was your biggest challenge?
Biggest challenge was when I found out the manufacturer of the programmable industry standard circuit board that I was trying to design a product around did not actually want their product out there. This meant I had to switch to a completely different programmable circuit platform, a process still being worked on. 

## What was your biggest succcess?
My greatest success was actually generating hype around my product. I had pitched it to Dr. Webber, who was about to buy 6 of the VisualCube 333N models for $300 before the news that I could not sell the product with its current components was discovered. Regardless, it was a very beneficial experience to see what it was like to ACTUALLY get an idea out to investors successfully.

## Do you have any future plans for this project?
For now, I plan to switch to the Arduino platform for the programmable circuit board. In the future I'd like to make my own programmable circuit board potentially using raspberry pi microcontroller chips, for a product with increased functionality. Arduino products unfortunately do not have some of the features (by default) my original VisualCube 333N did, so I will work to add in as many as I can to the Arduino products and my own custom programmable circuit. I may also do some beta testing lessons in the near future.
